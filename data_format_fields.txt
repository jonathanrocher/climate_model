MAX     103-108   Real   Maximum temperature reported during the 
                         day in Fahrenheit to tenths--time of max 
                         temp report varies by country and        
                         region, so this will sometimes not be    
                         the max for the calendar day.  Missing = 
                         9999.9     
Flag    109-109   Char   Blank indicates max temp was taken from the
                         explicit max temp report and not from the              
                         'hourly' data.  * indicates max temp was 
                         derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest
                         hourly or synoptic-reported temperature).

MIN     111-116   Real   Minimum temperature reported during the 
                         day in Fahrenheit to tenths--time of min 
                         temp report varies by country and        
                         region, so this will sometimes not be  
                         the min for the calendar day.  Missing = 
                         9999.9
Flag    117-117   Char   Blank indicates min temp was taken from the
                         explicit min temp report and not from the              
                         'hourly' data.  * indicates min temp was 
                         derived from the hourly data (i.e., lowest
                         hourly or synoptic-reported temperature).

PRCP    119-123   Real   Total precipitation (rain and/or melted
                         snow) reported during the day in inches
                         and hundredths; will usually not end 
                         with the midnight observation--i.e., 
                         may include latter part of previous day.
                         .00 indicates no measurable              
                         precipitation (includes a trace).        
                         Missing = 99.99
                         Note:  Many stations do not report '0' on
                         days with no precipitation--therefore,  
                         '99.99' will often appear on these days.
                         Also, for example, a station may only
                         report a 6-hour amount for the period 
                         during which rain fell.
                         See Flag field for source of data.
Flag    124-124   Char   A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation 
                             amount.
                         B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour 
                             precipitation amount.
                         C = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour 
                             precipitation amount.
                         D = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour 
                             precipitation amount.
                         E = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation
                             amount.
                         F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour
                             precipitation amount.
                         G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation
                             amount.
                         H = Station reported '0' as the amount
                             for the day (eg, from 6-hour reports),
                             but also reported at least one
                             occurrence of precipitation in hourly
                             observations--this could indicate a
                             trace occurred, but should be considered
                             as incomplete data for the day.
                         I = Station did not report any precip data
                             for the day and did not report any
                             occurrences of precipitation in its hourly
                             observations--it's still possible that
                             precip occurred but was not reported.

SNDP    126-130   Real   Snow depth in inches to tenths--last     
                         report for the day if reported more than
                         once.  Missing = 999.9
                         Note:  Most stations do not report '0' on
                         days with no snow on the ground--therefore,
                         '999.9' will often appear on these days.

FRSHTT  133-138   Int.   Indicators (1 = yes, 0 = no/not          
                         reported) for the occurrence during the 
                         day of:
                         Fog ('F' - 1st digit).
                         Rain or Drizzle ('R' - 2nd digit).
                         Snow or Ice Pellets ('S' - 3rd digit).
                         Hail ('H' - 4th digit).
                         Thunder ('T' - 5th digit).

                         digit).
